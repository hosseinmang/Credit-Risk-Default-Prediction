# Credit Risk Analysis Documentation

## Notebooks

This project contains two main notebooks that demonstrate the credit risk analysis process:

1. [Credit Risk Analysis (EDA)](credit_risk_analysis.html)
   - Exploratory Data Analysis
   - Feature Distribution Analysis
   - Correlation Studies
   - Risk Factor Analysis

2. [Credit Risk Modeling](credit_risk_modeling.html)
   - Model Development
   - Feature Engineering
   - Model Evaluation
   - SHAP Analysis

## Key Visualizations

The notebooks contain several important visualizations:

### Credit Risk Analysis
- Class Distribution Analysis
- Feature Correlations
- Age Group Risk Patterns
- Employment Duration Impact

### Credit Risk Modeling
- Model Performance Metrics
- Feature Importance Plots
- SHAP Value Analysis
- Risk Segmentation Visualization

## How to Use

1. You can view the notebooks directly in your browser by clicking the links above
2. Each notebook contains interactive visualizations and detailed analysis
3. The analysis is structured to flow from data exploration to model development

## Results Summary
